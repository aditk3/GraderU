Students nowadays have to go to multiple websites to find everything they would need to know before taking a class such as rateMyProfessor for professor reviews, Prof. Wade Ulmschneider’s website for GPA information, Reddit for class reviews and FAQs, and the UIUC course website for information such as semesters offered. We wanted a website with all this consolidated course information which would make decision-making easier and more efficient for the students which led to the idea of our website. We decided to add an additional unique feature which was the GPA calculator which would allow the student to calculated a predicted GPA of the semester based on courses taken (which also depends on which professor it is being taken with).

The dataset we used was [Prof. Wade Fagen-Ulmschneider’s dataset](https://github.com/wadefagen/datasets) on all the courses that have been offered at the U of I.
